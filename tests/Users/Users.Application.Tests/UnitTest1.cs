// This file intentionally left empty.
// According to TESTING_CONVENTIONS.md, Application unit tests should be avoided in favor of system tests.
// Only create Application unit tests for complex orchestration logic that cannot be easily tested through REST APIs.
//
// If Application unit tests become necessary in the future, follow these conventions:
// - Test naming: {MethodToTest}_{Scenario}_{ExpectedOutcome}
// - Use Test Object Builders for all test data
// - Follow AAA pattern with inline comments
// - Use inline literals in assertions rather than variables
