# Pertified

A .NET backend service for advanced project planning and estimation, designed to complement existing project management tools like Jira.

## Overview

Pertified provides sophisticated project analysis capabilities that most project management systems lack:

- **Three-point estimation** using optimistic, pessimistic, and best-guess scenarios
- **Work breakdown structure** for decomposing large tasks into manageable components  
- **Dependency mapping** and critical path identification

## Use Case

This tool is designed as a complementary analysis layer for existing project management systems. While platforms like Jira excel at tracking work, they often fall short in advanced planning and estimation scenarios.

## Typical Workflow

When using Pertified alongside Jira or similar systems:

1. **Import** large issues from your project management system for detailed analysis
2. **Break down** work by creating granular tasks and user stories
3. **Estimate** work effort using three-point analysis techniques
4. **Map dependencies** between tasks and identify the critical path
5. **Export** the refined tasks and estimates back to your source system

Pertified serves as a temporary analysis workspace. Once planning is complete, the refined work breakdown and estimates are transferred back to your primary project management system, which remains the single source of truth.
